# **Fitness Routine Planner**

## **Overview**

This Fitness Planner is a web application designed to offer a dynamic user experience for users looking to organize their fitness routine for a week. Utilizing the Document Object Model (DOM) and Browser Object Model (BOM), the application allows users to fill in their weekly fitness activities, view their planned exercises, and print the schedule for offline use. This application demonstrates proficiency in event-driven programming, leveraging DOM events to create an interactive interface that responds to user inputs in real time.

## **Objectives**

- **Dynamic User Experience**: Utilized DOM properties, methods, and techniques to create an interactive and responsive web application.
- **BOM Usage**: Implemented the window.onload method to ensure my script runs after the page fully loads, and window.print() to implement the print functionality when the Print button is clicked.
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Used proficiency with event-driven programming by implementing responsive, interactive features that react to user inputs and actions.
- **Form Validation**: Implemented basic form validation to ensure user inputs are correct before submission, using a combination of built-in HTML validation attributes and DOM-event-driven JavaScript validation.

## **Features**

- **Weekly Fitness Planning**: Users can plan their fitness routine by adding exercises for each day of the week.
- **Dynamic Content Generation**: The application dynamically generates content based on user interactions, allowing for a personalized workout schedule.
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can interact with the application through buttons and forms, with immediate feedback provided for their actions.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures that all user inputs meet specified criteria before allowing the submission of a fitness plan, promoting accurate and useful fitness schedules.
- **Printable Schedule**: Users can print their weekly fitness plan, making it easy to keep track of their exercises outside the digital realm.

## **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web application's content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the application, ensuring a pleasant and accessible user experience.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity to the web application, including event handling, DOM manipulation, and form validation.

## **How to Use**

1. **Open the Application**: Load the web application in your preferred browser.
2. **Fill the Form**: Enter your weekly fitness activities using the provided form. Each day of the week offers options to add different exercises along with their duration and intensity.
3. **Validate**: The application will validate your inputs as you fill the form, ensuring that all required fields are filled and formatted correctly.
4. **View Schedule**: Upon completion, view your weekly fitness plan displayed dynamically on the screen.
5. **Print Schedule**: Use the print option to print your fitness schedule for offline reference.

## **Development**

This project was developed with a focus on demonstrating the ability to manipulate the DOM for creating dynamic web applications. Event-driven programming principles were applied to ensure interactivity and responsiveness. The application's design aims to be user-friendly, facilitating easy navigation and operation for a wide range of users.
